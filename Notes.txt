1). performance.now()
The performance.now() method returns a DOMHighResTimeStamp, measured in milliseconds.The returned value represents the time elapsed since the time origin.

2). Auxillary Space Complexity means the space required by the algorithm and not considering the input space.

3). Some inbuilt searching functions: 
array.indexOf(___);
array.includes(___);
array.find(___);
array.findIndex(___);
**All of the above inbuilt function uses linear search.


4.) Array.sort();
Sorts the elements based on each character's unicode code point value, acc to string conversion of each element.
Only useful for sorting string and characters.

**But we can tell this sort() function how to behave, by passing a compare function to it and we implement our logic in that function. As per the logic implented in that function, accoringly sort() function will behave itself.


5). Array.reduce(funct());
figure out how this works

6).
    Beginning           End
Array.unshift(); <---> Array.push();
Array.shift();   <---> Array.pop();
